  The way shoppers engage online continues to become more fluid in terms of how
  they search for and purchase products. Now, more than ever, e-commerce is the
  new shopping normal and retailers are competing to offer the best optimized
  digital experiences and value. Black Friday 2019 was proof as shopping
  continued to shift from brick & mortar to the living room couch, with online
  spend hitting just over $7 billion, +23% vs prior year.


  Most recently, the current COVID-19 situation has accelerated this shift in
  behavior of shopping for groceries and staples online in an effort to practice
  social distancing. Post virus, we expect this shift will continue to grow.  


  What does this mean? Showing up well is more important than ever. Brands need
  to invest in creating an informative and compelling digital shelf and employ a
  demand generation strategy that highlights and spotlights their equity and
  unique benefits, or they risk not being seen. Let’s take a look at best
  practices for making the most of your products’ online presence.


  ## Incorporate brand storytelling into the digital shelf


  * Bring your brand to life beyond the packaging seen on a brick and mortar
  shelf. Don’t simply fill in the blank templates with images and copy. Allow
  your shoppers to experience your brand. In addition to packaging and
  ingredients, it’s important to demonstrate why your brand is the best. Why
  would I buy it, how would I use it? Is it for me, or for a party? Is it a
  gift?


  ## Pay attention to quality


  * Showing up well online has never been more important. It is no longer
  acceptable to simply upload low quality pictures of packaging and ingredient
  labels. They need to reflect the quality of your brand. Ensure your packaging
  images are easy to read and are mobile optimized. Include secondary images
  that highlight usage occasions. Make sure the copy is clear, succinct and
  seamlessly includes organic search terms.


  ## Have a demand generation strategy


  * Lastly, shoppers need to find your brand. To get prominent placement, you’ll
  need to ensure you have a strong paid search strategy and media plan that
  drives demand to your products and delivers an efficient ROI. Ratings and
  reviews are also important to help drive search results and sales.

  E-Commerce trends are evolving faster than predicted, especially with the
  recent pandemic.   Brands that deliver a compelling experience and get the
  digital shelf fundamentals right are poised to win the e-commerce sale.
