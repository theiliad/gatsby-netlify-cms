  ## Strong female voices are echoing across the globe, and brands are taking
  notice. We’ve had several clients who traditionally target men ask Mosaic for
  help in sparking conversations with women. These briefs inevitably lead to the
  same question: how can brands be more relevant to this sought-after and
  diverse demographic during this wave of women’s empowerment?

  If we look for advice from two of the most successful female-focused
  campaigns, Always’ #LikeAGirl and Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty, we could
  deduce that breaking stereotypes is the way to go if you want to capture
  women’s attention and win industry awards.


  Is breaking stereotypes the winning formula for marketing to women?
  Alternatively, is breaking stereotypes a marketing trend that needs to be
  broken? 


  If at the end of the day, we’re looking to grow brands and sell products to
  this audience, which path leads to real success?


  To redefine the negative connotation of doing things “like a girl”, Always
  asked girls of all ages to write their perceived limitations on boxes and then
  destroy them, for the world to see.


  The brand says their campaign is all about highlighting “the sexist undertones
  of a phrase that many people use without thinking twice, and the effect it can
  have on girls’ perceptions of themselves and their abilities.” 


  By featuring women of all shapes and sizes posing in their underwear, Dove
  aimed to challenge and redefine traditional beauty standards, urging and
  empowering women everywhere to embrace what makes them unique. It kick-started
  a debate about the portrayal of women in the media that continues to this day.


  Always’ #LikeAGirl and Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty were compelling,
  award-winning, and groundbreaking campaigns. As someone who spent eight years
  working on Dove and having it be the most important and satisfying work of my
  career, I am incredibly proud of campaigns like these.


  That said when I look at the lists of the most successful campaigns that
  market to women, almost every one centers around breaking stereotypes. Why?
  Because if every campaign geared at women takes the same approach, doesn’t it
  start to become inauthentic and redundant?


  I hypothesize that marketers feel they need to fight stereotypes or reveal a
  weakness around women in society to break through. Yes, this approach garners
  attention and tackles vital issues, but it can also be a red herring and
  detract from what every brand is actually trying to do – sell a product. Dove
  experienced this firsthand when I was still on the business. Brand equity
  scores were through the roof, but product sales didn’t follow until Dove
  revised the campaign to take on a more functional and product-forward
  approach.


  Remembering this, I began to search for campaigns that were more product
  focused for comparison. Although harder to find, here are two examples of
  campaigns that stand out and put their product first.

  ## “Reitmans. Really?”


  Reitmans needed to change the bias against their brand and convince consumers
  that it’s possible to find trendy and fashionable clothing at Reitmans.


  They launched anonymously at Montreal’s Fashion week, showcasing their clothes
  without publishing their brand and asked women where they think the clothes
  were from. Most guessed big fashion houses and renowned retailers before being
  told the truth: Reitmans. Their responses were, as we had anticipated,
  “Really?”


  Videos of the exploit broadcasted on TV and online in both languages and the
  stunt helped to create momentum leading up to the big reveal of Reitmans’ new
  ambassador. The public was finally introduced to Meghan Markle a few weeks
  later, with a TV commercial, web placements, out-of-home billboards, and
  in-store fashion advertising material. The humorous TV spot featured women
  struggling to get a peek at the labels on Meghan’s fabulous clothing and ended
  with Meghan informing them her outfit came from Reitmans—really. During each
  wave of the campaign, sales increased 69.6% and 72.8% respectively, and
  Meghan’s involvement achieved 18m impressions.

  ## Make History – Jim Beam


  “Whiskey and Women” was the research project that led to a new positioning for
  Jim Beam. “We found that 30% of the growth was coming from women” reported
  Rebecca Messina, SVP/global CMO for Beam Suntory. “In a beverage category
  where no one was talking about [or showing] women,” Jim Beam brought in
  actress Mila Kunis to carry the narration.


  The TV spot shows Mila branding Jim Beam barrels to celebrate the
  craftsmanship of bourbon and the “quality of the liquid,” according to the
  brand, which is aged for twice as long as the law requires for a Kentucky
  straight bourbon. Jim Beam is launching a second Mila Kunis ad in an effort to
  reach the expanding number of 18-34 whiskey drinkers after seeing 43% growth
  in the year following the launch of its “Make History” campaign.


  You may not be familiar with these two campaigns because they didn’t win the
  same awards as Dove and Always but do you think they were as impactful? Their
  case studies say yes. They both blew the doors off their sales and growth
  targets, but they did not raise the same levels of awareness.


  One could argue that both of the product-focused examples did, in their own
  way, break stereotypes. Reitmans changed the bias towards their brand, and Jim
  Beam was the first to talk to women in a primarily male category.


  So my question remains. Is a focus on breaking stereotypes the winning formula
  for marketing to women? Or in the spirit of 2019, is it time to break new
  ground and ditch the stereotypes all together? It will be interesting to watch
  where the trend takes us this year.
