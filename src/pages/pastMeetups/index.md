  Brandweek 2020 was unlike any that we’ve experienced in previous years. A
  fully virtual conference, marketers of all backgrounds, disciplines and
  industries were able to connect and share ideas that will undoubtedly shape
  the future of our industry.


  This year was particularly important as it was one of the first major industry
  gatherings to go digital that brought both agencies and brands together to
  learn how to navigate an ever-changing consumer landscape.


  Here are some of the most important learnings and how they can be applied to
  your brand


  ## The world changes quickly, brands must adapt with it


  2020 has shown our industry that we cannot rely on annual plans. While we can
  still strategize for the long term, we need to evaluate and adjust in the
  short-term to adapt to the world as it changes. Nearly every marketer that
  spoke touched upon the fact that they had to completely scrap or significantly
  pivot the programs they planned in Q4 2019. Short-term plans and faster
  turnaround times for campaigns have become the industry standard. In a world
  where media and culture are “always-on,” marketers need to be agile enough to
  adapt to overnight changes in social, cultural and business norms.


  ## Have a purpose; be authentic and empathetic


  Agility is necessary today because consumers want to hear from their favorite
  brands, even in uncertain times. However, moving quickly will only hurt your
  brand if it does not have a defined purpose and its tone is not authentic and
  empathetic.


  During their discussion, Frito-Lay VP of Marketing Sadira E. Furlow, Ally
  Financial Chief Marketing Officer Andrea Brimmer, and DoorDash Vice President
  of Marketing Kofi Amoo-Gottfried all emphasized the importance of showing up
  as a human and leading with generosity. This is more important than ever in
  today’s world, where many need to feel uplifted and need a little extra
  support.


  Brands that are rooted in kindness and authenticity will be the ones to win
  long-term. How does this happen? Through the leadership of the marketing team
  or agency. Marketers today must be the leaders that lead the development of an
  official brand purpose, if one does not already exist. Agencies must counsel
  their clients on rooting campaigns in values like kindness, generosity and
  empathy.


  ## Online communities are filling the consumer connection void, giving brands
  more ways to engage


  2020 has accelerated the role that digital plays in our lives. With many
  confined to their homes or choosing to live locally, consumers are looking for
  connection. Digital communities that offer genuine connection provide a
  solution – the omnipresent manicured social presence of the 2010s is now
  causing disconnect. Channels that offer direct, genuine connection like Reddit
  are having their moment.


  The platform saw a significant increase in users when the pandemic started.
  Sub-Reddit pages moderated by topical experts (the COVID page is moderated by
  epidemiologists), so there is a high level of trust and engagement among
  users. The channel is also a source of entertainment. Chief Operating Offier
  Jen Wong noted that those who came for information about how to stay safe at
  the start of the pandemic ended up staying for entertainment and connection.
  With a low barrier to entry for brand creative, Wong also pointed out that
  Reddit users welcome brands with an authentic message to the conversation.


  Does your brand want to have an authentic, meaningful discussion with
  customers? Actively participating by creating a community, facilitating AMA
  discussions or commenting on relevant sub-Reddits will connect all that are
  passionate about your brand’s mission.


  ## There is no room for error when it comes to diversity and inclusion or
  multicultural representation.


  Diversity and inclusion was a part of nearly every Brandweek discussion,
  making it clear that there is no room for error with organization D&I
  practices and multicultural representation in marketing.


  As with all marketing, diversity, inclusion and multicultural representation
  must be meaningful and authentic to the brand. DoorDash’s Kofi Amoo-Gottfried
  pointed out that companies need to do what they can with what they have. In an
  effort to lift up black entrepreneurs, DoorDash partnered with NBA players
  restarting the season in Orlando to highlight black-owned restaurants in their
  home team cities.


  Another common thread among all conversations was that representation must be
  prevalent in the entire marketing supply chain – the industry overall needs to
  improve how it recruits and retains employees of color. P&G’s Marc Pritchard
  said, “true diversity and inclusion fosters innovation and problem solving
  because people are allowed to bring their whole selves to work.”


  It’s important to know that while there is no room for error with diversity,
  inclusion and representation, everyone realizes that this might be new
  territory for some marketers. As Amoo-Gottfried said, this work will take a
  lifetime.


  ## Remember: 2020 Still Counts


  2020 should not be a year with an asterisk – as an industry, we have evolved.
  Now, we must push our industry to continue to be more agile, empathetic and
  progressive. The brand that weaves learnings from 2020 into its future
  strategy is the brand that will win in the hearts and minds of consumers in
  the future.
